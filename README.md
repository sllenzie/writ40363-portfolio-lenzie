Description:
    This project is a professional portfolio with information about me, my interests, my experiences, and my professional ambition. It features professional headshots of me, one which is intentionally longer in order to reflect the length of my "About Me" Section, in addition to my skills and various projects I have worked on over the past few years. 

Tech Used:
    The technology that I primarily used features GitHub, VS Code, and GitHub for Desktop. Additionally, the types of code that I used were exclusively HTML and CSS.

Notes:
    This was a lot of fun! I look forward to integrating further pages in order to go more in depth to the different things I have created and will create throughout this class.
