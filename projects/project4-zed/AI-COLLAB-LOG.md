sllenzie: good afternoon! i'd like to create a book review tracker, where the user would be able to sort their reviews by genre or by key words. i would also like to include a 5-star rating system, with a smooth and professional look via css. i would also like to implement local storage, so the user can return to the web app at any time and pick up where they left off.

Perfect! I've created a complete Book Review Tracker application for you. Here's what I've built:

## 📚 Project: Book Review Tracker

Located in: project5-bookreview

### ✨ Key Features Implemented:

**Core Functionality:**
- ⭐ **Interactive 5-star rating system** with smooth hover animations and click effects
- 📖 **Add book reviews** with title, author, genre, date, keywords, and detailed review text
- 🏷️ **11 genre categories** (Fiction, Mystery, Sci-Fi, Romance, etc.)
- 🔖 **Custom keyword tagging** for flexible organization

**Filtering & Search:**
- 🔍 **Filter by genre** - dropdown to show only specific genres
- 🔎 **Keyword search** - searches across title, author, review text, and tags
- 🎯 **Combined filtering** - use both filters simultaneously
- 🧹 **Clear filters** button to reset

**Design & UX:**
- 🎨 **Beautiful gradient background** (purple/indigo)
- 💫 **Smooth animations** - cards slide in, stars pop, hover effects
- 📱 **Fully responsive** - works on desktop, tablet, and mobile
- ✅ **Success notifications** - animated confirmation messages
- 🗑️ **Delete with confirmation** - prevents accidental removal

**Data Persistence:**
- 💾 **Local Storage integration** - all reviews automatically saved
- 🔄 **Persistent across sessions** - data survives browser restarts
- ⚡ **Real-time updates** - immediate save and display

### 🎯 Professional Touches:

1. **Smooth star rating** with scale transforms and color transitions
2. **Card hover effects** that lift and shadow
3. **Gradient buttons** with press animations
4. **Color-coded tags** for genres and keywords
5. **Empty state messaging** when no reviews exist
6. **Form validation** ensures required fields
7. **XSS protection** with HTML escaping

You can open `index.html` in your browser to start using it immediately. Try adding a few book reviews and testing the filters!
