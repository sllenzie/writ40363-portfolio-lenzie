        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>I'm a current senior Theatre major at Texas Christian University, with dual minors in Arts Leadership & Entrepreneurship and Digital Culture & Data Analytics, graduating in May of 2026. Throughout my time at TCU I have been blessed to work with two different arts organizations in the DFW area, the Fort Worth Opera and The Cliburn, in addition to becoming an Excellence in Public Speaking Finalist from the Bob Schieffer School of Communications and a part of the winning research group on “A Human-Centered AI Future” presented by the AddRan College of Liberal Arts. Lastly, I'm a three-time TCU Scholar and a five-time member of the Dean's List, with the opportunity for more.</p>
        <p>That's a laundry list of accomplishments. What it really boils down to is: I have professional experience in a variety of up-and-coming areas, nuanced approaches to problem solving, and the desire to learn more.</p>
	    <p>I have a passion for the arts- hence the theatre background and degree. I feel that live entertainment is a vital form of human expression, and I want to make it desirable and accessible to more people, not only because it is something important to me but also I believe it firmly has an important place in society.</p>

                <p>I spent a semester in the Fort Worth Opera offices, working on a variety of projects, ranging from ticket buyer analysis to pushing email and marketing campaigns, to the future season planning and implementation of different types of strategies to increase subscriber retention and single-ticket-buyer volume.

                <p>This summer, Fort Worth was the home to the Seventeenth International Van Cliburn Piano Competition. I was fortunate to have the opportunity to serve as head of Digital Media Sales as well as a liaison during the competition between Bass Hall and Maddox Muse where the simulcast was presented to non-ticket holders. After the competition, I presented my findings on the ticket buyer analysis and marketing successes to the CEO, as well as the Director of Marketing.</p>

                <h3>A Human-Centered AI Future Research Presentation</h3>
                <p>Myself and two other students set out to demonstrate clearly how AI is emphasizing bias in hiring because it cannot infer experiences, it discriminates against candidates, and alienates the applicants themselves. We presented this to a board of four professors, the dean of the college, and two outside consultants, and they felt our research and presentations were clear and present enough that we came in first place out of six groups.</p>

                <h3>Bob Schieffer College of Communications Excellence in Public Speaking Award</h3>
                <p>I was chosen from the group in a communications class that is required of any degree at TCU to represent Professor Cobb in front of a panel of judges, presenting a speech in a competition format. I needed to stand out among my peers at the class level, then among the best of the best. In the end, I made it through the finals round, presenting in front of the Dean of the school as well as the Vice Chancellor of the University, where I was ultimately awarded third place.</p>
