<p>I worked for the Fort Worth Oprea during Spring 2025, directly under the Director of Marketing and Communications. While there, I assisted with Front of House Operations during a major prodiction, began implementing a Production Archive that dated back to the beginning of the organization, and designed the surveys in order to illicit the most beneficial audience response.</p>

<h3>The Cliburn</h3>

<p>I had the pleasure of working for the 17th International Van Cliburn Piano Competition, taking place in Fort Worth, Texas, during the summer of 2025. While there, I served as the Head of Digital Media Sales, as well as serving a crucial audience-facing role during all performances of the competition. After the conclusion of the competition, I was able to analyze the audience data and determine whether the marketing strategies had particular successes or shortcomings.</p>

<h2>Current Learning</h2>
        <p>I am a three-time TCU Scholar and four-time member of the Dean's List, working toward finishing my BA degree in May of 2026. I'm currently enrolled in two concurrent coding classes, where I'm building the fundamentals of HTML and Python simultaneously. I hope to be able to utilize this knowledge for a personal project at the end of the semester. In addition to these technical courses, I am also taking Musical Theatre History, wherein I look forward to learning specifically about that particular area of impactful theatre.</p>

<h2>Resources</h2>

<p>In case you wanted to watch the new spinoff of the hit Showtime series, <i>Dexter</i> you can visit Paramount Plus <a href="https://www.paramountplus.com/?gclsrc=aw.ds&ds_rl=1289065&ftag=PPM-02-10ade4f&vndid=google$null$null$paramount%2B&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=17873670690&gbraid=0AAAAADtO7xFdoC_Um9lyrAIAZViSyXAJC&gclid=CjwKCAjwq9rFBhAIEiwAGVAZP05BkheZxF3j8v2UBGxLdhF05NudpxbrTWtPAMii-jMTlZ_aFu9bHRoCdisQAvD_BwE" target="_blank">here.</a></p>

<p>I'm very picky about my paper. By far, my favorite paper to take notes in and to journal with is from Karst stone paper, which you can purchase <a href="https://karstgoods.com/?tw_source=google&tw_adid=678398349037&tw_campaign=20708044991&tw_kwdid=kwd-547787472181&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=20708044991&gbraid=0AAAAADIUCUKkNU5wYuOkaHvDOT2hCITRR&gclid=CjwKCAjwq9rFBhAIEiwAGVAZP_mTM2TEXUoWczXf76jmqbjEr49g12hu44K_QviiigMUcqyC0PdowhoCvsMQAvD_BwE" target="_blank">here.</a></p>

<p>As I move into a later stage in my life, I find myself needing to purchase baby shower gifts for a lot of my close friends. The one that always is a huge hit is a customized lovey from <a href="https://bunniesbythebay.com" target="_blank">Bunnies By The Bay</a>, which is a small company that makes the softest stuffed toys. I have the seal of approval from four little ones, and there's a fifth coming soon!</p>
