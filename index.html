    <h1>Welcome! My name is Stella Lenzie.</h1>

     <h2>Professional Experience</h2>

    <!-- the paragraph below includes italics -->

    <p>I've held a variety of positions, but most recently I worked for The Seventeenth International Van Cliburn Piano Competition. There, I served in a complex and challenging audience-facing role, primarily as Head of Digital Media Sales. Additionally, after the competition's conclusion, I provided analysis of our audience members, as well as analysis of the marketing that had been done in specific parts of Texas and Oklahoma.</p>

    <h3>Goals</h3>

    <p>In this course, I specifically want to apply this knowledge to helping my mom with her website, in addition to fulfilling the minor requirements for DCDA. She has a small business and a domain name, but not really anything else- we're thinking about getting Wix but if I can try to figure out how to do it without Wix, then that would be even better!</p>
