    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <img src="images/profile.jpeg" width="50%">

    <p>I'm a senior BA Theatre major, with dual minors in DCDA and ARLE. I'm originally from Fort Worth, Texas, but I moved to LA when I was a kid, but I came back to the Fort for college! I currently serve on my sorority's executive board as "standards" or "justice" and I like spending time outside in my apartment's pool or reading.</p>
