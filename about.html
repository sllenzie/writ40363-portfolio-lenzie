    <h2>Background</h2>

    <img src="images/profile.jpeg" width="50%">

    <p>I'm a current senior, working towards finishing my Bachelor of Arts in Theatre, with dual minors in Digital Culture & Data Analytics as well as Arts Leadership & Entrepeneirship. I was born in Fort Worth, Texas, and am a fifth-generation Horned Frog! I lived in Palos Verdes, California for ten years prior to returning to TCU. While here, I've taken a number of classes, and am pleased to hold leadership positions within my sorority for three consecutive years, as well as holding two internships back to back.</p>

     <h2 id="skills"> Skills and Learning</h2>

    <p>Throughuot my time at TCU, I have developed and honed a number of skills including audience analysis and development, marketing interpretation and strategizing, and consumer satisfaction enhancement and engagement. Some of these skils were learned in the classroom, such as Audience Development and Marketing, but a great deal were truly developed with my professional experiences. Yes, I built the foundational experiences in the classroom, but I got a chance to truly implement them in the field.</p>

    <h2 id="goals"> Goals</h2>

    <p>In this course, I specifically want to apply this knowledge to helping my mom with her website, in addition to fulfilling the minor requirements for DCDA. She has a small business and a domain name, but not really anything else- we're thinking about getting Wix but if I can try to figure out how to do it without Wix, then that would be even better!</p>

     <h2 id="interests"> Interests</h2>
        <p>Outside of the corporate workforce, I love to read mystery and romance novels, catch up on re-runs of corny mystery television shows, and spend time with my sorority sisters and friends! I would say a guilty pleasure of mine is single-player story-based video games, because I can't resist a good story.</p>
