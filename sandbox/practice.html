        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>I'm a current senior Theatre major at Texas Christian University, with dual minors in Arts Leadership & Entrepreneurship and Digital Culture & Data Analytics, graduating in May of 2026. Throughout my time at TCU I have been blessed to work with two different arts organizations in the DFW area, the Fort Worth Opera and The Cliburn, in addition to becoming an Excellence in Public Speaking Finalist from the Bob Schieffer School of Communications and a part of the winning research group on “A Human-Centered AI Future” presented by the AddRan College of Liberal Arts. Lastly, I'm a three-time TCU Scholar and a five-time member of the Dean's List, with the opportunity for more.</p>
        <p>That's a laundry list of accomplishments. What it really boils down to is: I have professional experience in a variety of up-and-coming areas, nuanced approaches to problem solving, and the desire to learn more.</p>
	    <p>I have a passion for the arts- hence the theatre background and degree. I feel that live entertainment is a vital form of human expression, and I want to make it desirable and accessible to more people, not only because it is something important to me but also I believe it firmly has an important place in society.</p>
