# AI Collaboration Log - Project Zed

## Tools Used:
- **Zed Editor**: Primary development environment with AI assistant integration
- **AI Assistant**: Claude Sonnet 4.5
- **Additional Tools**: I also used Google's Gemmini Pro 2.0 in order to generate images for the about me section.

## Learning Moments:
- I found that I needed to be incredibly specific with what I wanted, in order to get the results I was looking for.
- I also found that the more I pointed out what I was looking at and for, the more it was likely to help.

## Challenges:
- There was a sticky moment where the scroll feature absolutely refused to not jump to the top of the page every time that the page was reloaded, but when I specifically asked to fix that it was an easy fix. 

## Process Evolution:
- **Initial Approach**: I spoke to the AI like I would speak to any colleague, in a professional and respectful manner, but was very detailed about what I was looking for in the results. 
- **Refinements**: Once I was more nitpicky, then it became more efficent in the way I got what I was looking for. 
- **Final Workflow**: By the end of the project, I was actually seeing what I could do to fix what I was doing, instead of asking the AI assistant, instead of the other way around. 
- **Key Takeaways**: Next time, I might do something different as far as the initial setup of the website.

### Conversation 2: [Trying to get the Images I wanted]

sllenzie: in the about card that references my education, develop an interesting and conceptual svg file to replace the cliche graduation cap emoji

GitHub Copilot: I'll create a unique SVG to replace the graduation cap emoji in the about card. Let me first look at the current HTML to see how it's structured. 

Read [](file:///Users/stellalenzie/Documents/GitHub/writ40363-portfolio-lenzie/projects/project4.1-enhancedportfolio/index.html)

Now I'll create a conceptual SVG that represents education in a more interesting way. I'll create an SVG that combines elements of knowledge, growth, and learning - using a book with sprouting ideas/light. 

Created [](file:///Users/stellalenzie/Documents/GitHub/writ40363-portfolio-lenzie/projects/project4.1-enhancedportfolio/images/education-icon.svg)

Now I'll update the HTML to use the SVG instead of the emoji: 

Using "Replace String in File"
```
```
Perfect! I've created a conceptual SVG that represents education through:

- **An open book** as the foundation of learning
- **Three lightbulbs sprouting from the book** representing ideas, innovation, and enlightenment that come from education
- **Organic stems connecting the book to the ideas** suggesting growth and development
- **Different colored lightbulbs** (warm yellow, blue, and purple) symbolizing diverse fields of knowledge
- **Small sparkles** adding a touch of inspiration and discovery
- **Page lines** giving the book texture and depth

This design moves away from the cliché graduation cap and instead focuses on the conceptual aspects of education: knowledge sprouting new ideas, continuous growth, and enlightenment. The SVG is fully scalable and uses a modern, clean aesthetic that should fit well with your portfolio design.

Made changes.

sllenzie: how big should this image be keeping in mind that i want this to be mobile and desktop friendly

GitHub Copilot: Let me check the current CSS to see how the card icons are styled: 

Read [](file:///Users/stellalenzie/Documents/GitHub/writ40363-portfolio-lenzie/projects/project4.1-enhancedportfolio/css/styles.css)

Perfect! I can see that `.card-icon` is set to `font-size: 3rem` (which is approximately 48px). For optimal mobile and desktop responsiveness, I'll create the SVG at **48x48 pixels** as the base size in the viewBox, but make it scalable. The CSS will handle the responsive sizing automatically.

Here's the revised approach: 

Created [](file:///Users/stellalenzie/Documents/GitHub/writ40363-portfolio-lenzie/projects/project4.1-enhancedportfolio/images/education-icon.svg)

Using "Replace String in File"
```

```
Perfect! The SVG is now sized at **48x48 pixels** to match your existing `.card-icon` styling. Here's why this works well for mobile and desktop:

**Key Features:**
- **Scalable:** The SVG will automatically inherit the `font-size: 3rem` from `.card-icon` CSS
- **Responsive:** On mobile (max-width: 480px), everything scales proportionally
- **Crisp at any size:** Vector graphics remain sharp on all screen resolutions including Retina displays
- **No inline styles needed:** The CSS already handles the sizing, so the SVG adapts automatically

The icon will display at approximately:
- **Desktop:** ~48px (3rem based on default 16px root)
- **Mobile:** Proportionally scaled with the rest of the card content
- **High-DPI screens:** Perfectly sharp without pixelation

Made changes.

sllenzie: i'd like to add the image that i uploaded in the images folder and replace the emoji of the graduation cap in the about card that references my education

GitHub Copilot: Let me check what image you uploaded to the images folder: 

Read [](file:///Users/stellalenzie/Documents/GitHub/writ40363-portfolio-lenzie/projects/project4.1-enhancedportfolio/images)

Perfect! I'll replace the graduation cap emoji with your uploaded image: 

Using "Replace String in File"


```

```
Done! Your uploaded image now replaces the graduation cap emoji in the education card. The image will automatically scale to match the size of the other card icons (approximately 48px) thanks to the existing CSS styling.

Made changes.

sllenzie: i'd like to add a specific section in the .about-card styling in css that ensures that any image is scaled down to 48x48 pixels

GitHub Copilot: Using "Replace String in File"


```

```
Done! Any image inside `.card-icon` will now be constrained to exactly 48x48 pixels, with `object-fit: contain` ensuring the image scales proportionally without distortion.

Made changes.


### Conversation 3: [Adding in CSS styling to match the rest of the portfolio]

sllenzie: I want to add css styling for the section class "projects" that is in the top part of the index file. I want it to match the rest of the style of the portfolio, including all the accessibility previously mentioned

GitHub Copilot: Let me first check the index file to see the projects section structure: 

Searched for text `projects` (`**/index.html`), 16 results

Let me read the root index.html file to see the full projects section: 

Read [](file:///Users/stellalenzie/Documents/GitHub/writ40363-portfolio-lenzie/index.html)

sllenzie: @agent Try Again

GitHub Copilot: Now let me check the current CSS file to see what exists: 

Read [](file:///Users/stellalenzie/Documents/GitHub/writ40363-portfolio-lenzie/css/styles.css)

Now I'll add comprehensive CSS styling for the `.projects` section that matches the portfolio's style with proper accessibility features: 

Using "Replace String in File"


```

```
Now let me add responsive styles for the projects section in the media queries: 

Using "Replace String in File"


```

```


Using "Replace String in File"


```

```
Perfect! I've added comprehensive CSS styling for the `.projects` section that matches your portfolio's aesthetic and includes all accessibility features:

**Key features added:**

1. **Visual Design:**
   - Gradient background matching the portfolio's pink palette
   - Card-based layout with rounded corners and shadows
   - Smooth hover effects with color transitions and animations
   - Decorative underline on the heading matching other sections

2. **Accessibility:**
   - Clear focus states with 3px outline and offset for keyboard navigation
   - Sufficient color contrast (deep rose on white background)
   - Hover indicators (arrow animation, color change, transform)
   - Touch-friendly spacing on mobile devices

3. **Responsive Design:**
   - Adapts seamlessly from desktop to mobile
   - Adjusted font sizes and spacing for smaller screens
   - Arrow indicator hidden on very small screens for clarity
   - Maintains readability at all viewport sizes

4. **Smooth Interactions:**
   - Hover transforms (slide effect)
   - Border color transitions
   - Shadow depth changes
   - Arrow animation on hover

The section now perfectly matches the style of your portfolio while maintaining excellent accessibility and user experience across all devices!

Made changes.

sllenzie: the text does not seem to be visible... please fix!

GitHub Copilot: Let me check the current CSS file to see what's happening: 

Searched for regex `\.projects` (`**/css/styles.css`), 19 results

Read [](file:///Users/stellalenzie/Documents/GitHub/writ40363-portfolio-lenzie/css/styles.css#56-56), lines 56 to 146

The CSS looks correct. Let me check the section styling to see if there's an opacity issue: 

Searched for text `section {` (`**/css/styles.css`), 7 results

Read [](file:///Users/stellalenzie/Documents/GitHub/writ40363-portfolio-lenzie/css/styles.css#404-404), lines 404 to 419

Found it! The issue is that all `section` elements have `opacity: 0` by default and need the `.visible` class to be visible. The `.projects` section needs to override this or have initial visibility. Let me fix this: 

Using "Replace String in File"
```

```
Perfect! The issue was that all `section` elements in your CSS have `opacity: 0` by default and require a `.visible` class (likely added by JavaScript on scroll) to become visible. I've added `opacity: 1 !important` and `transform: none !important` to the `.projects` section to ensure it's always visible, overriding the default section styling. The text should now be visible!

Made changes.

sllenzie: When the page reloads, it seems to automatically scroll to the bottom. Is there a way to stop that?

GitHub Copilot: Searched for text `id="contact"` (`**/index.html`), 2 results

Searched for files matching `**/js/script.js`, 3 matches

Read [](file:///Users/stellalenzie/Documents/GitHub/writ40363-portfolio-lenzie/js/script.js)

The issue is likely caused by the browser trying to restore scroll position. Let me add code to prevent this and ensure the page loads at the top: 

Using "Replace String in File"

```

```
Perfect! I've added code to prevent the automatic scrolling issue:

1. **Disabled scroll restoration** - Tells the browser not to remember and restore the scroll position
2. **Force scroll to top on page load** - Ensures the page always starts at the top
3. **Reset on unload** - Prepares for the next page load

The page will now always load at the top instead of jumping to a previous scroll position!

Made changes.
